To successfully place an order, you need to include the following headers in your API request:

<ParamField header="X-Api-Key" type="string" required>
  The API key you created in the previous step.
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="X-Idempotency-Key" type="string" required>
  A unique value that we use to prevent duplicate purchases. If a network error
  occurs, you can retry the request with the same idempotency key and we will
  return the original order without any danger of creating a new one. You can
  read more about how we handle this field in the [idempotency
  guide](/best-practices/idempotency).

For testing you can just make one up, but you **must** generate a unique value for each order you intend to make. We suggest using a V4 UUID for this field.

</ParamField>

<ParamField header="X-Api-Version" type="string">
  The API version you want to use. This header is optional but we highly
  recommend you to set it. For this guide, we will use the latest version
  `2024-02-05`
</ParamField>
