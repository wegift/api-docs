#### The distribution method

As mentioned we have two options here, `EMAIL` and `PAYOUT_LINK`.

- `EMAIL`: This will send the payout link directly to the end user's email inbox.
- `PAYOUT_LINK`: This will return the payout link in the response body.
- `RECIPIENT`: This is used for payment type products, we won't be using this in this guide.

##### To distribute via `EMAIL`

<Columns cols={2}>
  <div>
    <ParamField body="type" children="distribution_method" type="string" required>
      Set the distribution method type as `EMAIL`
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="email_address" children="distribution_method" type="string" required>
      Set the email address you want to send this payout link to.
    </ParamField>
  </div>
  <div>
    ```json
    "distribution_method": {
      "type": "EMAIL",
      "email_address": "recipient@example.com"
    }
    ```
  </div>
</Columns>

<Info>
The playground environment by default does not send emails. To enable this, you need to set the `X-Send-Email: true` header.

Ensure you refer to the [playground reference](/reference/2024-02-05/playground#sending-emails) for more details.

##### To distribute via `PAYOUT_LINK`

<Columns cols={2}>
  <div>
    <ParamField body="type" children="distribution_method" type="string" required>
      Set the distribution method type as `PAYOUT_LINK`
    </ParamField>
  </div>
  <div>
    ```json
    "distribution_method": {
      "type": "PAYOUT_LINK"
    }
    ```
  </div>
</Columns>

#### The product selection

There are three options here, `SINGLE`, `MULTIPLE` and `TEMPLATE`.

- `SINGLE`: This will create a payout link for the selected product, the end user will receive a link for the chosen value exactly.
- `MULTIPLE`: This will create payout link where the end user can choose to split the value between multiple products.
- `TEMPLATE`: This will create a payout link as defined by a [pre-built template](/features/merchant-selection-template).

As we've not pulled the [product catalog](/features/product-catalog) we'll use `TEMPLATE` for this example. In the playground environment we have a [pre-defined template](/reference/2024-02-05/playground#default-product-selection-templates) we can use for USD that will give us a payout link with 10 randomized products.

On the `products` object we will set the `type` to `TEMPLATE` and the `template_id` to `PT-01HQ12PV4B8XMBRTK281JM54KK`. The `template_id` is the ID of the template we want to use.

<ParamField body="type" children="products" type="string" required>
  Set the product selection type to `TEMPLATE`
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="template_id" children="products" type="string" required>
  Set the template ID to `PT-01HQ12PV4B8XMBRTK281JM54KK`, a [pre-defined
  playground
  template](/reference/2024-02-05/playground#default-product-selection-templates)
  for USD.
</ParamField>
