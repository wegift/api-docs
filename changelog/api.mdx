<Update label="September 2025" tags={["Feature", "Ordering"]}>

## New metadata field added to ordering endpoint

We've added a new `metadata` field to the ordering endpoint. You can use this field to attach additional, customer-specific data to the order. This is for your internal use, the information stored here will not be exposed to the end user.

When you query for an order we will return the metadata you have attached to the order.

We support up to 20 key-value pairs, keys have a maximum length of 40 characters, and values can be up to 200 characters long. Both keys and values must be strings.

Check out the [order create reference](/reference/2024-02-05/endpoint/orders/create#body-metadata) for more details.

### Example

Let's say you're placing orders for a campaign. You could attach several key-value pairs to the order to map the Runa order to your internal order ID, which department is running the campaign, and which campaign the order belongs to.

```json
"metadata": {
  "internal_id": "12345",
  "department": "marketing",
  "campaign": "summer_2024"
}
```

## Order Estimate now supports Embedded FX orders

We are glad to announce that you can use the `POST /v2/order/estimate` endpoint to get the price estimate for an Embedded FX order.

Please refer to the Order Estimate [API reference](/reference/2024-02-05/endpoint/orders/estimate) the request and response for details.

More examples can also be found in the [Embedded FX guide](/features/embedded-fx).

<Update label="July 2025" tags={["Feature", "Catalog"]}>

## Filtering the product catalog by category

We have introduced two new features to enhance how you work with product categories in the API.

### Filter products by category

The [List products](/reference/2024-02-05/endpoint/products/list) endpoint now supports a `categories` query string parameter. You can use this to filter the product catalog by one or more categories. To specify multiple categories, repeat the parameter for each category, e.g. `?categories=fashion&categories=department-stores`.

### List all available categories

Filtering needs knowledge of the available categories. You can now fetch the full list of product categories supported by the API using the [List categories](/reference/2024-02-05/endpoint/products/categories) endpoint making it easier to build dynamic category selectors or validate category names.

</Update>

<Update label="March 2025" tags={["Feature", "Payment", "Ordering"]}>
## New payment payout type added
To support the release of [Runa Pay to Card](https://runa.io/products/pay-to-card) a new payout type of `payment` has been added to the product catalog. This new type joins the existing types of `gift_card` and `subscription`. For `payment` type products the new `payment` key will contain specific details about the product.

[Runa Pay to Card](https://runa.io/products/pay-to-card) enables you to push funds to global cards and bank accounts instantly. Funds can be sent instantly to billions of users in 190 countries, powered by Visa Direct and Mastercard. Existing customers should contact their account manager for more details.

### Updated endpoints

- [Retrieve products](/reference/2024-02-05/endpoint/products/list)
  - When `payout_type` is `payment` the `payment` key will contain specific details about the products assets, denominations and resources.
- [Retrieve a single product's details](/reference/2024-02-05/endpoint/products/get)
  - When `payout_type` is `payment` the `payment` key will contain specific details about the products assets, denominations and resources.

## 2023-01-16 API version end-of-life

As of **31 January 2025** the **2023-01-16** version of the API is no longer available.

Our new API versions have improved reliability and performance, plus additional features such as embedded foreign exchange at time of ordering.

All affected customers were notified ahead of time. As of today requests for the specific version using the `X-Api-Version` header will respond with a `410 Gone` error code. Requests without this header will default to the current API version.

For more details on our versioning strategy see the [API versioning](/best-practices/api-versioning) page.

</Update>

<Update label="January 2025" tags={["Feature", "Catalog", "Webhook"]}>
## Product orderable state now supported in the Product Update webhook
You can now receive programmatic real-time updates to the availability of products, the `is_orderable` field is now a supported field in the [Product Update webhook](/reference/2024-02-05/webhook/product.update).

### Use cases

- Updating a local replica or cache of product availability. If you keep a copy of your product catalog the availability of products could become out of sync. Using the product update webhook you can update this copy in real-time ensuring your customers don't face ordering issues for unavailable products.
- Getting live quicker with new products and products awaiting approval. The moment a product is ready for you to use the webhook will let you know.
- Notifying your customers of the availability of products in the Runa network.

### Example

The webhook sends you both the previous and the new state of the product so you can take action on what has changed. Note here the product has gone from unorderable to orderable.

```json
{
  "product_code": "PRCODE-GB",
  "old_state": {
    "price_multiplier": "0.9",
    "is_orderable": false
  },
  "new_state": {
    "price_multiplier": "0.8",
    "is_orderable": true
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-04-10T17:11:26.601254"
}
```

Check the [Product Update webhook reference](/reference/2024-02-05/webhook/product.update) for full details.

### Getting started with webhooks

If you're not already using webhooks to receive real-time updates from Runa about the product catalog or the state of orders you can [read about getting started here](/reference/webhooks).

## API verion 2023-07-27 released

- Changes to request and response for Order operations: This version includes significant updates to the request and response mechanisms for creating, retrieving, and listing orders. Please refer to the updated API documentation for new structures and fields.
- Removal of Get Links operation: To streamline our API and improve efficiency, we have removed the 'get links' operation previously used to retrieve payout links of an order. This change reduces the required API calls to place and retrieve a payout link order from three to two.
