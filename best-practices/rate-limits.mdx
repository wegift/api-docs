API requests to create orders are subject to rate limiting. If the rate is exceeded, you'll get an HTTP `429 Too Many Requests` response. Your API client code should be able to handle this response and retry the request after a short period.

  Orders are currently limited to **180 per minute**. This includes requests
  that fail due to errors. This rate limit may change in the future.

# Handling rate limits

If you receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response you should wait a short period before retrying the request. We recommend waiting at least 5 seconds before retrying the request. If you continue to receive the same response you should wait longer before retrying.

# Need a higher rate limit?

If you need a higher rate limit for your integration, please contact your account manager. We can discuss your requirements and provide a suitable rate limit for your use case.
