<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the API keys page">
    Navigate to the [API section](https://app.runa.io/api-keys) within your account dashboard. Click the "Create new API key" button to generate a new API key.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose the environment">
    You now need to choose the environment to create the API key in. For this guide we will use the playground environment.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Give the API key a name">
    You should give the API key a name that will help you identify it. This is helpful when managing multiple API keys. It's best practice to generate new keys for each use case and revoke them when they are no longer needed.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy the API key">
    After the key is created it will be displayed to you only once. You should copy the key and store it securely. If you loose the key you will need to revoke it and generate a new one.

#### Securing your API key

It is your responsibility to keep your API keys safe and secure. Anyone holding your key will be able to make requests to the API on your behalf.
Review our [security best practices](/best-practices/security) for information on how to keep your API keys secure.

# The API keys page

Once you have created an API key you can view it on the [API keys page](/getting-started/api-keys). You can also revoke any keys from this page. You can read more in the [authentication guide](/best-practices/authentication).

# Using the API key

When making requests to the API you will need to include the API key in the request headers. It must be included in the `X-Api-Key` header for all requests.

```http
X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY
```
