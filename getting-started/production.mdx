## Setting up a payment method
When setting up a payment method for your order, you need to pay from a Runa account balance.

## Topping up your Account Balance
Once you have accepted our terms and conditions, you have the option to top up your account balance using either a bank transfer or a card payment. Topping up your account balance via bank transfer is free of charge.

To add funds to your account balance through a bank transfer, simply follow the instructions. Please go to Billing Overview, and click on "Add Funds" to initiate this process.

Alternatively, you can choose to top up your account balance using a card payment. However, card payments may be subject to associated fees. These will be indicated during the payment process.
