## Business verification

To enable live transactions and access production balances, your account must complete KYB (Know Your Business) and EDD (Enhanced Due Diligence) checks. This process verifies your business and its key stakeholders.

These steps are legally required and typically involve providing business registration details and ID checks for key individuals. Runa will send you the necessary onboarding documentation for both processes.

## Funding your account

API orders are paid for from your Runa account balance. Before placing production orders, your balance must be funded. Check the [currencies reference page](/reference/currencies) for the list of supported currencies.

### Topping up your Account Balance
Once you have accepted the terms and conditions, you can top up your account balance using either a **bank transfer** or a **card payment**.
