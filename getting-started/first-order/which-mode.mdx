The Runa API provides two execution modes: **synchronous** and **asynchronous**. Synchronous does all the work in one go and returns a response with the payout links. Asynchronous on the other hand returns earlier with just the order id and then you can poll or listen for a completed event.

The limiting factor for the synchronous mode is that you can only create one payout per transaction.

  <Card title="Synchronous" icon="arrow-right-arrow-left" href="/getting-started/first-order/sync">
    If your orders are small with one order per transaction, the synchronous mode would be better for you.

    <br />

    It enables direct retrieval of payout links from the order response, streamlining integration into a single step.

  </Card>
  <Card title="Asynchronous" icon="rotate" href="/getting-started/first-order/async">
    For larger orders involving multiple payout links, the recommended approach is asynchronous mode.

    <br />

    This mode enables you to initiate the order first and then either poll an additional API endpoint for payout links or receive the payout links via a webhook, thereby creating a two-step integration process.

## Which one is right for you?

Whether you choose synchronous or asynchronous mode the integration remains simple and straightforward. The same features are available in both modes with the only limitation that in synchronous mode you can only create one payout per transaction.
