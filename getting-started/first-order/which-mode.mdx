To offer customers maximum flexibility in integration and ensure consistent performance, the Runa API provides two execution modes: **synchronous** and **asynchronous**.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Synchronous" icon="arrow-right-arrow-left" href='sync'>
    If your orders are small with one order per transaction, the synchronous mode would be better for you.
    <br />
    It enables direct retrieval of payout links from the order response, streamlining integration into a single step.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Asynchronous" icon="rotate" href='async'>
    For larger orders involving multiple payout links, the recommended approach is asynchronous mode.
    <br />
    This mode enables you to initiate the order first and then either poll an additional API endpoint for payout links or receive the payout links via a webhook, thereby creating a two-step integration process.

## Which one is right for you?

Comprehensive guides are available to demonstrate the implementation of both execution modes. Whether you choose synchronous or asynchronous mode, integration remains simple and straightforward.
