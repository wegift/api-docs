## The URL

import GettingStartedTheUrl from "/snippets/getting-started-the-url.mdx";

<GettingStartedTheUrl />

## What headers do I need to send?

import GettingStartedCommonHeaders from "/snippets/getting-started-common-headers.mdx";

<GettingStartedCommonHeaders />

<ParamField header="X-Execution-Mode" type="string" default="async">
  Set the value of this header to `async` as we are using the synchronous
  execution mode for this guide. If omitted, the default value is `async` but we
  still recommend you set it for explicitness.
</ParamField>

Putting this all together the full headers we need to send are:

```http
X-Api-Key: <your-api-key>
X-Idempotency-Key: <your-idempotency-key>
X-Api-Version: 2024-02-05
X-Execution-Mode: async
```

## The request body

import GettingStartedRequestBody from "/snippets/getting-started-request-body.mdx";

<GettingStartedRequestBody />

```json [expandable]
{
  "payment_method": {
    "type": "ACCOUNT_BALANCE",
    "currency": "USD"
  },
  "items": [
    {
      "face_value": 10,
      "distribution_method": { "type": "PAYOUT_LINK" },
      "products": {
        "type": "TEMPLATE",
        "template_id": "PT-01HQ12PV4B8XMBRTK281JM54KK"
      }
    },
    {
      "face_value": 20,
      "distribution_method": { "type": "PAYOUT_LINK" },
      "products": {
        "type": "TEMPLATE",
        "template_id": "PT-01HQ12PV4B8XMBRTK281JM54KK"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### The payment method

import GettingStartedPaymentMethod from "/snippets/getting-started-payment-method.mdx";

<GettingStartedPaymentMethod />

### The order items

As we are using the asynchronous execution mode, we can order multiple payout links at a time. The following fields are set on the items within the `items` array:

import GettingStartedOrderItem from "/snippets/getting-started-order-item.mdx";

<GettingStartedOrderItem />

## Putting it all together

### The request

Here's the complete request we'll be sending to the API.

```http The Request Headers
POST https://playground.runa.io/v2/order
X-Api-Key: <your-api-key>
X-Idempotency-Key: <your-idempotency-key>
X-Api-Version: 2024-02-05
X-Execution-Mode: sync
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json The Request Body
{
  "payment_method": {
    "type": "ACCOUNT_BALANCE",
    "currency": "USD"
  },
  "items": [
    {
      "face_value": 10,
      "distribution_method": { "type": "PAYOUT_LINK" },
      "products": {
        "type": "TEMPLATE",
        "template_id": "PT-01HQ12PV4B8XMBRTK281JM54KK"
      }
    },
    {
      "face_value": 20,
      "distribution_method": { "type": "PAYOUT_LINK" },
      "products": {
        "type": "TEMPLATE",
        "template_id": "PT-01HQ12PV4B8XMBRTK281JM54KK"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### The initial response

For async orders the response to the request will only contain the order ID and the status of the order. This is because the order is processing in the background.

```json The Intermediate Response
{
  "id": "O-01234567890ABCDEFGHIJK",
  "status": "PROCESSING"
}
```

You should take note of the order ID as you will need it to fetch the order details later.

### Getting the order details

If you wait a short period and then fetch the order details using the [get order details](/reference/2024-02-05/endpoint/orders/get) endpoint you're able to fetch the same details available when using the synchronous ordering mode.

<Info>
  The order status will be `PROCESSING` for a short period of time after it is
  accepted. On the playground environment this is simulated by a 1 second delay.
</Info>

The URL to fetch the order details is:

```
https://playground.runa.io/v2/order/{order-id}
```

The response will be a `200 OK` with the order details in the body. You can retrieve the payout links from the `payout.url` fields from the `items` array.

```json The Response {25,42}
{
  "id": "O-01234567890ABCDEFGHIJK",
  "status": "COMPLETED",
  "created_at": "2025-01-01T12:00:00+00:00",
  "completed_at": "2025-01-01T12:00:01+00:00",
  "description": null,
  "payment_method": {
    "type": "ACCOUNT_BALANCE"
  },
  "currency": "USD",
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "E-01234567890ABCDEFGHIJK",
      "distribution_method": { "type": "PAYOUT_LINK" },
      "products": {
        "type": "TEMPLATE",
        "template_id": "PT-01HQ12PV4B8XMBRTK281JM54KK",
        "values": [ ... ]
      },
      "face_value": "10.00",
      "price": "10.00",
      "payout": {
        "status": "ACTIVE",
        "status_updated_at": "2025-01-01T12:00:01+00:00",
        "url": "https://payout.playground.runa.io/01234567-0000-4000-abcd-012345678900",
      },
      "currency": "USD"
    },
    {
      "id": "E-11234567890ABCDEFGHIJK",
      "distribution_method": { "type": "PAYOUT_LINK" },
      "products": {
        "type": "TEMPLATE",
        "template_id": "PT-01HQ12PV4B8XMBRTK281JM54KK",
        "values": [ ... ]
      },
      "face_value": "20.00",
      "price": "20.00",
      "payout": {
        "status": "ACTIVE",
        "status_updated_at": "2025-01-01T12:00:01+00:00",
        "url": "https://payout.playground.runa.io/11234567-0000-4000-abcd-012345678900",
      },
      "currency": "USD"
    }
  ],
}
```

Pop the `url` field into your browser to see the payout link. Congratulations, you've just made your first order with Runa.

### Webhooks

While you can fetch the order details after a short delay, in reality this would require you to poll the endpoint until the order is completed. This is not ideal and may lead to rate limiting issues. Instead we have the [order completion webhook](/reference/2024-02-05/webhook/order.completion) available for you to use.

If you intend to use the async ordering mode you should take a look at the [webhooks](/reference/webhooks) section to see how to set one up. Unfortunately the playground environment does not support webhooks so you will need to use a real environment to test this out.
