When you place an order, the total price depends on the value of the items you're purchasing.

To provide you with a clear breakdown of the order price before you confirm your purchase the [estimate order](/reference/2024-02-05/endpoint/orders/estimate) endpoint can optionally be used to get your estimated order price including fees. It accepts a request similar to the one used for creating an order and responds with a detailed breakdown of the estimated price for both the overall order and each individual item within the order.

<Note>Please note that the order price estimate endpoint does **not** support Embedded FX orders.</Note>

Below is an estimate request and response for an order with 2 order items.

The response contains fields that are related to the order price.

- Price of each item is presented in the `price` field.
- The `total_price` is the sum of all order item prices
