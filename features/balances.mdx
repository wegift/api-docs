Your balance is the amount of money available in your account to pay for orders. If you don't have enough balance, attempts to order will be rejected with a `insufficient_funds` error.

We offer a number of ways to check your balance and set up alerts to notify you when your balance is low.

- An API endpoint to fetch your current balance, either for all currencies or for a single currency
- Predictive balance emails when your balance is expected to become low based on your previous order volumes
- Custom balance thresholds that notify you when your balance falls below a specific threshold

You may hold balances in multiple currencies. See the list of [supported currencies](/reference/currencies) for an understanding of available options.

## Checking balances in the API

The [balance endpoint](/reference/2024-02-05/endpoint/balance/get) can be used to fetch balances for all currencies or for a single currency.

### Checking all available balances

To retrieve information on all balances associated with your account, initiate a GET request to the `/v2/balance` endpoint.

Each object in the array represents the total available balance for a specific currency:

- `balance` denotes the current available funding for the specified currency
- `currency` is represented by the ISO4217 three-letter currency code

```json
[
  {
    "balance": "1200.00",
    "currency": "CAD"
  },
  {
    "balance": "500.00",
    "currency": "EUR"
  },
  {
    "balance": "12500.00",
    "currency": "GBP"
  },
  {
    "balance": "45000",
    "currency": "JPY"
  },
  {
    "balance": "19.50",
    "currency": "USD"
  }
]
```

### Checking the balance for a single currency

To obtain the balance for a specific currency, include the three-letter currency code in the GET request: `/v2/balance/?currency=[CURRENCY]`

For example, a request to `/v2/balance/?currency=GBP` will yield a single object in response. This API responds to other currencies with a value of 0, as long as the currency is supported on our platform.

- `balance` denotes the current available funding for the specified currency
- `currency` is represented by the ISO4217 three-letter currency code

```json
{
  "balance": "1200.00",
  "currency": "CAD"
}
```

## Setting up alerts

Two types of alerts are available. **Predictive balance emails** automatically notify you when your balance is expected to become low based on your previous order volumes. **Custom balance thresholds** allow you to set a specific balance threshold and be notified when your balance falls below that threshold.

Both types of alerts can be configured in the Runa dashboard under the [settings page](https://app.runa.io/user/settings).
