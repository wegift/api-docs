Before you go live with Runa Pay to Card you will need to sign updated T&Cs. Please reach out to your Account Manager or email [support@runa.io](mailto:support@runa.io) to complete this step.

# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Getting started

- Ensure you have [created an API key](/docs/getting-an-api-key).
- Ensure you have funded your account with the required balance to cover the payments you intend to make. You can use the [balances endpoint](/docs/balances) to check your account balance.
- Retrieve the Pay to Card products using the [product list endpoint](/reference/getproducts). You can identify these products by the `payout_type` field, which will be set to `payment`. Each Pay to Card product supports a specific currency and country. You can refer to the [product listing guide](/docs/product-listing-guide) for more information on this endpoint.
- Familiarize yourself with the [ordering endpoint](/docs/make-your-first-order). To make an order for a payment you simply specify the Pay to Card product code for the currency and country you wish to send funds in.
- Place an order for a pay to card payment. You can opt for us to send the payment to the recipient's email address by using the `EMAIL` distribution method or you can send the payment link to the recipient yourself by using the `LINK` method.

## Example pay to card order

The following is an example of a pay to card order for a $10 payment to a recipient in the US. The payment will be sent to the recipient's email address.

```http
POST https://api.runa.io/v2/order
Content-Type: application/json
X-Api-Key: <your API key>

{
    "payment_method": {
        "type": "ACCOUNT_BALANCE",
        "currency": "USD"
    },
    "items": [
        {
            "face_value": 10,
            "distribution_method": {
                "type": "EMAIL",
                "email_address": "<your recipient's email address>"
            },
            "products": {
                "type": "SINGLE",
                "values": ["P2C-US"]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Refer to the [order endpoint reference](/reference/createorder) for more information on the request schema and other options available.

# üí≥ Pay to Card redemption experience

<img src="https://files.readme.io/2762a396699a34a065c99bd63868fc5f13315d6e96f2892c6a6cb9c88781a127-p2c-flow-diagram.png" />

When a recipient opens the payment they will be guided through the following flow on their first redemption:

1. Enter their email address to authenticate
2. Securely enter their card details
3. Receive funds in their bank account

For a returning recipient, they will only need to enter their email address to authenticate. The previously used card details are saved for future redemptions.

5. Fraud Suspected
   - If fraud is suspected, we will hold on sending out the payout until we have established that the payment isn‚Äôt fraudulent. During this time, we will either ask the end recipient to share additional information, or we will have to cancel the payment and inform you that it‚Äôs been cancelled with a reason as to why.
6. Recipient bank has rejected payment
   - The most common payment issue we are likely to experience is the recipient's bank rejecting the payment we send them. If this happens we will send the recipient an email to say their bank has rejected the payment, with advice to either resolve this with their bank or to contact us to manually delete their card so they can try a different card.
