After the recipient clicks on their Payout Link, they will be directed to a page where they can choose from a selection of available products. They have the flexibility to decide how they want to allocate the face value of their balance among these products.

The recipient has the option to split the total balance across multiple available products, as illustrated in the example below.

</Frame>

To restrict the available products in a Payout Link, you can define the desired products within the order items when making a request to the [Create Order](/reference/2024-02-05/endpoint/orders/create) endpoint. Here are some examples to assist you in creating your payload.

Below is an order request that allows the end user to allocate their face value across two products, namely Amazon and Adidas UK:

```json
{
  "payment_method": {
    "type": "ACCOUNT_BALANCE",
    "currency": "GBP"
  },
  "items": [
    {
      "face_value": 10,
      "distribution_method": {
        "type": "PAYOUT_LINK"
      },
      "products": {
        "type": "MULTIPLE",
        "values": ["AMZ-GB", "ADAS-GB"]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

If you'd like to restrict the product selection to a single product, please refer to the example order request below. This limits the user to redeem their total face value on a single product, specifically Amazon UK:

```json
{
  "payment_method": {
    "type": "ACCOUNT_BALANCE",
    "currency": "GBP"
  },
  "items": [
    {
      "face_value": 10,
      "distribution_method": {
        "type": "PAYOUT_LINK"
      },
      "products": {
        "type": "SINGLE",
        "value": "AMZ-GB"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

<Warning>
**Multiple country orders are not supported**

Please be aware that when placing an order, it is essential to ensure that all selected `products` within the order `items` belong to the same country. We currently do not support combining products from different countries in a single order. Your order will be rejected.

</Warning>

## Exploring and Selecting Products from Runa Product Network

To choose the products you want to include in your order, you can explore Runa's product network using the [List Products](/reference/2024-02-05/endpoint/products/list) endpoint. Follow the steps below to utilize this endpoint effectively:

1. To get a list of all supported countries, you can use [supported countries](/reference/2024-02-05/endpoint/products/countries)
2. Make a request to the [List Products](/reference/2024-02-05/endpoint/products/list) endpoint. You can optionally filter by one or more countries from the list returned above.

To quickly test out the endpoint and view the product list, you can navigate to the API reference for the [List Products](/reference/2024-02-05/endpoint/products/list) endpoint.

Here is an example of a successful response that demonstrates how the listing will be returned:
