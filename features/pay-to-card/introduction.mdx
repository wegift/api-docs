You can refer to the [product listing guide](/features/product-catalog) for more information on this endpoint.
- To make an order for a payment you simply specify the Pay to Card product code for the currency and country you wish to send funds in.
- Place an order for a pay to card payment. You can opt for us to send the payment to the recipient's email address by using the `EMAIL` or `RECIPIENT` distribution method or you can send the payment link to the recipient yourself by using the `LINK` method.

When a recipient opens the payment they will be guided through the following flow on their first redemption:

1. Enter their email address to authenticate
2. Securely enter their card details
3. Receive funds in their bank account

For a returning recipient, they will only need to enter their email address to authenticate. The previously used card details are saved for future redemptions.
