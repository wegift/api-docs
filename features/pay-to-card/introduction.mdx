## Fetching the Pay to Card products

Retrieve the Pay to Card products using the [product list endpoint](/reference/2024-02-05/endpoint/products/list). You can identify these products by the `payout_type` field, which will be set to `payment`. Each Pay to Card product supports a specific currency and country. You can refer to the [product listing guide](/features/product-catalog) for more information on this endpoint.

```json title="Pay to Card product example, fields truncated to for brevity" icon="file" expandable
{
  "code": "P2C-US",
  "name": "Pay To Card US",
  "currency": "USD",
  "state": "LIVE",
  "payout_type": "payment",
  "is_orderable": true,
  "availability": "realtime"
}
```

## Placing a Pay to Card order

To make an order for a payment you simply specify the Pay to Card product code for the currency and country you wish to send funds in.

For our example we will be using the `P2C-US` product code for a $10 payment to a recipient. The payment will be sent to the recipient's email address via the `EMAIL` distribution method.

```http title="Example pay to card order" icon="globe" expandable
POST https://api.runa.io/v2/order
Content-Type: application/json
X-Api-Key: <your API key>

{
    "payment_method": {
        "type": "ACCOUNT_BALANCE",
        "currency": "USD"
    },
    "items": [
        {
            "face_value": 10,
            "distribution_method": {
                "type": "EMAIL",
                "email_address": "<your recipient's email address>"
            },
            "products": {
                "type": "SINGLE",
                "values": ["P2C-US"]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### Distribution methods

In the example above we used the `EMAIL` distribution method to send the payment to the recipient's email address.

- You can also use the `RECIPIENT` distribution method to send the payment to a known recipient.
- If you want to handle the distribution of the payment link yourself, use the `PAYOUT_LINK` distribution method.

Refer to the [order endpoint reference](/reference/2024-02-05/endpoint/orders/create) for more information on the request schema and other options available.

## Recipient redemption experience

When a recipient opens the payment they will be guided through the following flow on their first redemption:

1. Enter their email address to authenticate
2. Securely enter their card details
3. Receive funds in their bank account

For a returning recipient, they will only need to enter their email address to authenticate. The previously used card details are saved for future redemptions.
