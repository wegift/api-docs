The Pay to Card redemption journey requires a few steps from the recipient. To test this journey in the playground environment, you can use the following steps.

<Info>
  For testing and simulating errors during placing of the order, refer to the
  [playground reference section](/docs/playground).
</Info>

Here's a high level summary of the Pay to Card redemption journey:

You're able to walk through each step of the journey in the playground environment.

<Info>
  **Delivery of links for orders is disabled in the playground environment by
  default**
  <br />
  Every distribution method will still return a link in the `payout.url` field
  that you can use to access the redemption journey. See the [playground
  reference](/docs/playground) for more information.
</Info>

## Testing the redemption journey

After placing the order, you can access the redemption journey by following the link in the `payout.url` field.

### Email verification

Playground supports email verification via one time code, just like our live environment.

You can test both successful and error cases by trying scenarios such as:

1. Correct email and code.
2. Incorrect code.

### Billing address and card details

<Warning>
  Never enter your actual address or card details on playground links.
</Warning>

There is no billing address validation in the Playground environment, so you can use any dummy address.

The playground environment only works with a specific set of cards. Use the following cards to trigger different scenarios.

1. Valid card details

   Use the following details to trigger a success response:

   Card Number: `4111 1111 1111 1111`

   CVV, Expiry Date, and Cardholder name: any values

2. Card details for validation error

   Following should immediately trigger a warning for incorrect card number

   Card Number: `4111 1111 1111 1112`

   CVV, Expiry Date, and Cardholder name: any values

### The returning user case

A returning user will already have their card and other details saved.

To simulate a returning recipient flow in the Playground environment, append `+repeat` to the username part of your email address.

For example, if your email is `user.name@mailserver.com`, use `user.name+repeat@mailserver.com`.

You will still receive the one-time code in your usual inbox.
