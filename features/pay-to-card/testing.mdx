This document covers testing process for Pay to Card redemption journey. For testing and simulating errors during ordering, refer to [Runa API Playground section](/docs/playground).

Here's a high level summary of the Pay to Card redemption journey:

Different parts of the journey and steps to simulate successful and error scenarios at each step are described below. 

Note that email delivery of links is disabled in playground by default. You can still use the link returned from our API response to proceed.

###  ✉️ Email verification

Playground supports email verification via one time code, just like our live environment.

You can test both successful and error cases by trying scenarios such as:
1. Correct email and code.
2. Incorrect code.




#### 💳 Billing address and card details

<Warning>
  Never enter your actual address or card details on playground links.
</Warning>

There is no billing address validation in the Playground environment, so you can use any dummy address.

The playground environment only works with a specific set of cards. Use the following cards to trigger different scenarios.

1. Valid card details
   
   Use the following details to trigger a success response:
   
   Card Number: `4111 1111 1111 1111`
   
   CVV, Expiry Date, and Cardholder name: any values

2. Card details for validation error
   
   Following should immediately trigger a warning for incorrect card number
   
   Card Number: `4111 1111 1111 1112`
   
   CVV, Expiry Date, and Cardholder name: any values

#### Returning user

A returning user will already have their card and other details saved.

To simulate a returning recipient flow in the Playground environment, append `+repeat` to the username part of your email address.

For example, if your email is `user.name@mailserver.com`, use `user.name+repeat@mailserver.com`.

You will still receive the one-time code in your usual inbox.
