We've categorized potential errors into three distinct areas, and for each, we've developed specific contingency plans and operational procedures.

## Recipient errors

These are errors that can be self-corrected by your recipients.

### Payment details

1. Issue with the card number
   - Recipient will see the error message: `The card number you have entered is incorrect.`
2. Card is unsupported
   - Recipient will see the error message: `The card you have entered is not supported. Please use a Visa or Mastercard debit card.`


## Order errors

These are the errors that will require your input to resolve

### Recipient ineligible

1. Payments cannot be sent to anyone under 18 years old.
   - Recipient will see the error message: `We cannot send funds to anyone under the age of 18.`
2. Payments cannot be sent to anyone who appears on a sanctions list.
   - Recipient will see the error message: `There's been an unexpected issue, please contact the issuer of this link.`
   - Runa will send you an email to inform you that this has happened, with our reasoning attached.
3. Card issue
   - Payment sent to a Recipient who doesn't have an eligible debit card with Visa/Mastercard.
   - Recipient will see the error message: `We can only send funds to a Visa or Mastercard debit card.`

In these cases, we recommend cancelling the payout link by logging into your Runa portal. Please use an alternate payout mechanism to tranfer the funds to your recipient.

## Processing errors

### In-journey errors

1. Authentication error: Recipient hasn't received email with code, or the code is not working
   - Recipient will need to contact Runa for us to investigate what might have gone wrong with authentication.
2. Fraud Suspected
   - If fraud is suspected, we will hold on sending out the payout until we have established that the payment is genuine. During this time, we will either ask the end recipient to share additional information, or we will have to cancel the payment and inform you that it's been cancelled with a reason as to why.
3. Recipient bank has rejected payment
   - The most common payment issue we are likely to experience is the recipient's bank rejecting the payment we send them. If this happens, we will send the recipient an email to say their bank has rejected the payment, with advice to either resolve this with their bank or try a different card.
