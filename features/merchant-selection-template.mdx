You can create and use merchant selection templates to enhance the flexibility of your order creation workflow. By defining payout types in templates, you can easily reuse them across multiple orders, streamlining the payout selection experience for your users.

<Info>
**Merchant selection templates are predefined in the Playground environment**

Templates you create yourself cannot be used in the Playground environment. Instead we supply a predefined set of template IDs for testing purposes. See [the playground documentation](/reference/2024-02-05/playground#default-product-selection-templates) for more details.

## Using Payout Templates

<Steps>
    <Step title="Creating a payout selection template">
        Visit [Merchant selection templates](https://app.runa.io/customization/payout-selection) to create a template.

        <Frame caption="Interface for creating a merchant selection template">
          ![Merchant selection template](/assets/screenshots/new-merchant-template.png)
        </Frame>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Grab the template ID">
        After creating Payout Type Template, you will be assigned a unique template ID. This ID is essential for associating your predefined payout types with specific products on the Runa API.

        <Frame caption="The template ID is displayed on the template page">
          ![Merchant selection template](/assets/screenshots/merchant-template-id.png)
        </Frame>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Use the template ID in your order request">
        When placing an order

        - Set the `type` of the `products` object to `TEMPLATE`
        - Set the `template_id` in the `products` object to the ID you have obtained from the previous step.
        - Ensure the `face_value` is a whole number and equal or greater than the minimum face value of the products selected.

        ```json Request example {9-12}
        {
            "payment_method": {
                "type": "ACCOUNT_BALANCE",
                "currency": "GBP"
            },
            "items": [
                {
                    "face_value": 10,
                    "products": {
                        "type": "TEMPLATE",
                        "template_id": "YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID"
                    },
                    "distribution_method": {
                        "type": "PAYOUT_LINK"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
        ```

        See the [order request reference](/reference/2024-02-05/endpoint/orders/create#body-distribution-method-template-id) for more details.
    </Step>

</Steps>

### Minimum payout value

For payout link to contain all the selected payout options, you will need to meet a minimum face value during ordering. Although it is not strict requirement, it ensures that _any_ of the payout options can be redeemed. If no products meet the face value requirement the order will be rejected.

When creating the merchant template you will be shown the minimum value.
