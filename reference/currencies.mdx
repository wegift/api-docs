The `currency` field used throughout API specification represents a dynamic set of currencies that are supported on the Runa platform. As we expand into new markets, the list of currencies we support will expand. As a result your implementation will need to handle the addition of new values returned in this field, for example as part of the [list products](/reference/2024-02-05/endpoint/products/list) endpoint, as well as using only those specified below as part of your requests.

A list of currently supported currencies is below, we'll update this as we add more to our platform, however as mentioned prior, your implementation should gracefully handle these additions.

<Note>
  For currencies labelled _from USD only_, products purchased in these
  currencies using Embedded FX must use USD as payment method.
