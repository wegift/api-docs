Some Runa API endpoints split large sets of results into multiple pages. We return an array of records and a token to get the next page of data. The tokens are cursor-based rather than page numbers to prevent missing or duplicating returned records if new items are added to the set while you're paging through the results.

## Paging through results

A `pagination` object is returned for paged endpoints, use the `after` cursor to get the next page of results.

```json Pagination object in a response {3}
"pagination": {
    "cursors": {
        "after": "ZXYzz",
        "before": "ABCaa"
    },
    "page": {
        "limit": 100
    }
}
```

For the above response you would add `?after=ZXYzz` to the request to get the next page of results.

## Detecting the end of the results

The `after` cursor is always returned in the response if there are results in the current page. There are no more results if you receive an empty data array in the response.

## Paging backwards

You can page in reverse by using the `before` cursor. For example you would `?before=ABCaa` to the request to get the previous page of results.

## Controlling the number of records returned

Some endpoints support a `limit` parameter to control the number of records returned. The default page size is documented in the endpoint's reference.
