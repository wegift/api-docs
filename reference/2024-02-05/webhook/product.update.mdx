  Webhooks work differently to the API endpoints. Take a read of our guide to
  understand how they work.
</Card>

An event is triggered when there is an update to a product in the catalog. If multiple products are updated at once, an event is triggered for each product.

Use the `product_code` to identify the product that was updated, then refer to the `old_state` and `new_state` to determine the changes. A `timestamp` is provided to indicate when the update occurred.

<Info>
  Due to the nature of webhooks you should not rely on the order of the events.
  You should store the `timestamp` and discard any events that are older than
  the last event you received.
