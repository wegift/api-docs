  Webhooks work differently to the API endpoints. Take a read of our guide to
  understand how they work.
</Card>

An event is triggered when there is an update to a product in the catalog. If multiple products are updated at once, an event is triggered for each product.

Use the `product_code` to identify the product that was updated, then refer to the `old_state` and `new_state` to determine the changes. A `timestamp` is provided to indicate when the update occurred.

<Info>
  Due to the nature of webhooks you should not rely on the order of the events.
  You should store the `timestamp` and discard any events that are older than
  the last event you received.
</Info>

<Warning>
The primary purpose of this webhook is to prevent order failures. Always update your catalog promptly when receiving these events to ensure the best customer experience.
</Warning>

## How to Use This Webhook

This webhook helps you keep your product catalog synchronized with Runa's system and minimize order failures. Here's how to handle each field:

### Product Availability (`is_orderable`)

**When a product becomes non-orderable:**
- **Action:** Immediately disable the product in your catalog
- **Reason:** New orders will be rejected by Runa's system
- **Implementation:** Hide the product from customers or mark as "Currently Unavailable"
- **Example:** 
  ```json
  {
    "product_code": "AMAZON-US",
    "old_state": {
      "price_multiplier": "0.0098",
      "is_orderable": true,
      "denominations": {
        "type": "fixed",
        "available_list": ["10", "25", "50"],
        "minimum_value": "10.0",
        "maximum_value": "50.0"
      }
    },
    "new_state": {
      "price_multiplier": "0.0098",
      "is_orderable": false,
      "denominations": {
        "type": "fixed",
        "available_list": ["10", "25", "50"],
        "minimum_value": "10.0",
        "maximum_value": "50.0"
      }
    },
    "timestamp": "2025-08-26T18:39:27.006833+00:00"
  }
  ```

**When a product becomes orderable again:**
- **Action:** Re-enable the product in your catalog
- **Reason:** Orders can now be successfully processed
- **Example:**
  ```json
  {
    "product_code": "AMAZON-US",
    "old_state": {
      "price_multiplier": "0.0098",
      "is_orderable": false,
      "denominations": {
        "type": "fixed",
        "available_list": ["10", "25", "50"],
        "minimum_value": "10.0",
        "maximum_value": "50.0"
      }
    },
    "new_state": {
      "price_multiplier": "0.0098",
      "is_orderable": true,
      "denominations": {
        "type": "fixed",
        "available_list": ["10", "25", "50"],
        "minimum_value": "10.0",
        "maximum_value": "50.0"
      }
    },
    "timestamp": "2025-08-26T18:39:27.006833+00:00"
  }
  ```

### Pricing Changes (`price_multiplier`)

**When the price multiplier changes:**
- **Action:** Update your product pricing and discounts accordingly
- **Implementation:** Use the new multiplier to calculate updated prices
- **Note:** For detailed pricing questions, contact your account manager
- **Example:**
  ```json
  {
    "product_code": "STARBUCKS-US",
    "old_state": {
      "price_multiplier": "0.0095",
      "is_orderable": true,
      "denominations": {
        "type": "fixed",
        "available_list": ["10", "25", "50"],
        "minimum_value": "10.0",
        "maximum_value": "50.0"
      }
    },
    "new_state": {
      "price_multiplier": "0.0090",
      "is_orderable": true,
      "denominations": {
        "type": "fixed",
        "available_list": ["10", "25", "50"],
        "minimum_value": "10.0",
        "maximum_value": "50.0"
      }
    },
    "timestamp": "2025-08-26T18:39:27.006833+00:00"
  }
  ```

### Denomination Updates (`denominations`)

The `denominations` object represents available purchase amounts for a product. There are two types:

- **Fixed denominations** - Predetermined amounts like $10, $25, $50
- **Open denominations** - Any amount within a specified range

**For Fixed Denomination Products:**

**When denominations are removed from `available_list`:**
- **Action:** Remove those denominations from your product options
- **Reason:** Specific denominations are out of stock - orders for these amounts will fail
- **Example:** 
  ```json
  {
    "product_code": "MSFT-US",
    "old_state": {
      "price_multiplier": "0.0104",
      "is_orderable": true,
      "denominations": {
        "type": "fixed",
        "available_list": ["15", "25", "50", "100"],
        "minimum_value": "15.0",
        "maximum_value": "100.0"
      }
    },
    "new_state": {
      "price_multiplier": "0.0104",
      "is_orderable": true,
      "denominations": {
        "type": "fixed",
        "available_list": ["25", "50", "100"],
        "minimum_value": "25.0",
        "maximum_value": "100.0"
      }
    },
    "timestamp": "2025-08-26T18:39:27.006833+00:00"
  }
  ```
  Remove the $15 option from your interface.

**When denominations are added back to `available_list`:**
- **Action:** Re-enable those denomination options
- **Reason:** Stock has been replenished for those amounts
- **Example:**
  ```json
  {
    "product_code": "MSFT-US",
    "old_state": {
      "price_multiplier": "0.0104",
      "is_orderable": true,
      "denominations": {
        "type": "fixed",
        "available_list": ["15", "25", "50", "100"],
        "minimum_value": "15.0",
        "maximum_value": "100.0"
      }
    },
    "new_state": {
      "price_multiplier": "0.0104",
      "is_orderable": true,
      "denominations": {
        "type": "fixed",
        "available_list": ["5", "15", "25", "50", "100"],
        "minimum_value": "5.0",
        "maximum_value": "100.0"
      }
    },
    "timestamp": "2025-08-26T18:39:27.006833+00:00"
  }
  ```
  Add the $5 option to your interface.

**For Open Denomination Products:**

**When `minimum_value` or `maximum_value` changes:**
- **Action:** Update your input validation and UI constraints
- **Reason:** Orders outside the new range will be rejected
- **Example:**
  ```json
  {
    "product_code": "VISA-PREPAID-US",
    "old_state": {
      "price_multiplier": "1.0",
      "is_orderable": true,
      "denominations": {
        "type": "open",
        "minimum_value": "5",
        "maximum_value": "500"
      }
    },
    "new_state": {
      "price_multiplier": "1.0", 
      "is_orderable": true,
      "denominations": {
        "type": "open",
        "minimum_value": "10",
        "maximum_value": "300"
      }
    },
    "timestamp": "2024-04-10T17:11:26.601254"
  }
  ```
  Update your form validation to only accept amounts between $10-$300.

**Note:** When a product becomes non-orderable (`is_orderable: false`), both the `denominations` and `price_multiplier` information are preserved and continue to show the same values that were available when the product was orderable.
