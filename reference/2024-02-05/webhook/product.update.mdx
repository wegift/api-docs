  Webhooks work differently to the API endpoints. Take a read of our guide to
  understand how they work.
</Card>

An event is triggered when there is an update to a product in the catalog. If multiple products are updated at once, an event is triggered for each product.

Use the `product_code` to identify the product that was updated, then refer to the `old_state` and `new_state` to determine the changes. A `timestamp` is provided to indicate when the update occurred.

<Info>
  Due to the nature of webhooks you should not rely on the order of the events.
  You should store the `timestamp` and discard any events that are older than
  the last event you received.

## Denomination Structure

The `denominations` object within both `old_state` and `new_state` represents the available purchase amounts for a product. It has the following structure:

### Properties

- `type` - The denomination type, either:
  - `"fixed"` - Product has predetermined fixed denominations
  - `"open"` - Product accepts any amount within specified range

- `available_list` - Array of strings representing available denomination amounts (only for `"fixed"` type)

- `minimum_value` - String representing the minimum purchase amount (only for `"open"` type)

- `maximum_value` - String representing the maximum purchase amount (only for `"open"` type)

### Usage Examples

#### Fixed Denominations
```json
{
  "denominations": {
    "type": "fixed",
    "available_list": ["10", "25", "50", "100"]
  }
}
```

#### Open Denominations
```json
{
  "denominations": {
    "type": "open",
    "minimum_value": "5",
    "maximum_value": "500"
  }
}
```

#### Product Becomes Non-Orderable
```json
{
  "denominations": {
    "type": "fixed",
    "available_list": []
  }
}
```

When a product becomes non-orderable (`is_orderable: false`), the `denominations.available_list` will be empty for fixed denomination products.
