Our endpoints return standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request. In the event of an error, the response body will contain a JSON object with `type`, `message`, and `help` keys. For example:

```json
{
  "type": "example",
  "message": "This is an example error",
  "help": "This is how you can fix it"
}
```

You can use the `type` key to programmatically handle different error scenarios. The `message` and `help` keys offer human readable descriptions of the error and may vary depending on the specific error.

## Error types

The following is a list of error types that may be returned by our API. The message and help fields are examples and may vary depending on the specific error.
